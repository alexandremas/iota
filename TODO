First Release Roadmap:

- Iota Controller View gets factored out into Markio, cleaned up.
- Iota Model factored out into its own things, refactored
- Consider changing the way Markio works completely, first creating an 
  abstract syntax tree.  (Thus allowing removal or refactoring of things
  that don't quite work.)
- Consider ditching MVC for a simple Rack-like way of doing things
- Think through changing the way Iota Model works...
  - I'm forcing the pattern onto a system it doesn't work on (prototype 
    vs. class)
  - Maybe there should be a singleton object that has finder and various
    other table-wide methods on it
  - Then we have a Iota Model Row object which gets filled in with row
    related methods
