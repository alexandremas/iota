Create a new clone of Markio for each document.  Each of these clones will have an output variable.  Parse the input.  Rather than returning strings, the :forward method will concatenate strings onto the output variable. 

That means... 
tags called from within loops and other control structures get properly output to the stream

However... div ( "blah" ) will not work by default...

because the return values are not automatically output to the stream...

so... some sort of...
Markio > := method(blah, append(blah))

div( >"blah" )

html(
  head( title( >"My Title" ) ),
  body(
    h1( >"Tyler's Page" ) ) )

Or we could create an AST while parsing through the document.  Then, on-demand, that AST could be converted into a string. This idea is kind of cool because it could be output converted to different doctypes.  On the otherhand, I'm never actually going to do that... and I don't know anyone who would use it.  Cool in theory though.
