Iota is a small web application framework written in Io.  (Get it? Iota? Hah.)
It is insanely far from production-ready.  It has not even been extracted from
the sample application which I've been developing it around.  Things will
change... and break... and then get fixed... only to break again.  But I'm
pleased with how it's going, so maybe you'll like it as well.
